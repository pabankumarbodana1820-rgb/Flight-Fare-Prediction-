## ✈️ Flight Fare Prediction (Machine Learning )

## 📌 Project Overview

Flight ticket prices vary based on multiple factors such as airline, source, destination, journey date, stops, and duration.
This project builds a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to predict flight fares based on user inputs.

The model is deployed using Streamlit Web App for real-time fare prediction.
